## Running the App

To run this FastAPI app, you will need to use Uvicorn. You can start the app with the following command:

```shell
uvicorn your_app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
Replace `your_app` with the name of your FastAPI application script and `app` with the name of the FastAPI instance within your script. You can also specify the host and port as needed.
